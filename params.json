{"name":"FXMisc","tagline":"Miscellaneous JavaFX applications and libraries.","body":"### About FXMisc\r\n\r\nFXMisc is an umbrella project for various [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/)-related projects. The goal is to help developers publish their project the standard way - obeying the [package naming conventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package#Package_naming_conventions) and publishing project artifacts to [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#browse). At the same time, you retain _complete control_ of your project. We take no credit or responsibility for your project.\r\n\r\n### What exactly does FXMisc offer to a project?\r\n\r\n* Endorsement to use **org.fxmisc._yourproject_** package name.\r\n* List the project on this site ([fxmisc.org](http://www.fxmisc.org/)).\r\n* Redirect **http://fxmisc.org/yourproject** to your project website (hosted e.g. on GitHub).\r\n\r\nThat's it &mdash; no more, no less.\r\n\r\n### How is that supposed to help?\r\n\r\nWhen publishing a Java project, the package name should follow the convention and start with the reversed domain name of a site you control. If you don't think that your project deserves a dedicated domain name (yet), you may find `org.fxmisc.yourproject` more appealing than, say, `com.github.yourname.yourproject`. Also, you probably don't want to rename your packages if you switch to a different project hosting site.\r\n\r\nHaving control over the `http://fxmisc.org/yourproject` URL makes you eligible to [register your project at the Sonatype repository](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide) with **groupId** `org.fxmisc.yourproject`.\r\n\r\n### What projects are eligible for FXMisc?\r\n\r\nWe don't judge the usefulness or quality of your project. The only two requirements are:\r\n\r\n1. **JavaFX-related.** Note that the language is not restricted to Java. Other JVM languages are welcome as well.\r\n2. **Open-source.**\r\n\r\n### How to apply?\r\n\r\n[Open a new issue](https://github.com/FXMisc/fxmisc.github.io/issues/new) with label \"new project\" and provide the following information:\r\n* **Project name**, e.g. `YourProjectFX`.\r\n* **Package name**, e.g. `yourproject`. Don't ask for a package name that is too general, like ~~`util`~~ or ~~`misc`~~.\r\n* **Project web site**, e.g. `https://github.com/yourname/YourProjectFX`. We will set up redirection from `http://fxmisc.org/yourproject` to this site.\r\n* **Project description** (optional, max. 250 characters).\r\n\r\n### How does FXMisc compare to others?\r\n\r\nYou may consider contributing to other open-source projects like [ControlsFX](http://controlsfx.org/) or [JFXtras](http://jfxtras.org/). The difference is that you are _not_ contributing your project to FXMisc. You retain complete control of your project, remember? This gives you **more freedom**, but at the same time **less support**.\r\n\r\n#### More freedom\r\n\r\nComplete control means that, among other things:\r\n\r\n* We don't judge the quality of your code or documentation.\r\n* We don't restrict the scope of your project.\r\n* We don't care whether your project has third-party dependencies.\r\n* We don't claim any rights to your project.\r\n* We don't care what license you use (as long as your project is open-source).\r\n* We don't care where you host your source code.\r\n* We don't care whether you use Git, Mercurial or anything else.\r\n* We don't care what build tool you use.\r\n* It's OK if you later decide that your project deserves its own domain name or that you want to contribute it to another open-source project. There are no strings attached.\r\n\r\n#### Less support\r\n\r\nComplete control also means that:\r\n\r\n* You have to write your own build scripts.\r\n* You have to manage the release cycle yourself.\r\n* You have to [register your project with Sonatype](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide) yourself to get your artifacts to Maven Central Repository.\r\n* You have to create the web presentation yourself.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
